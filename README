this is a Python script for you to get you favorite song list from DoubanFM,

fm_get_music.py: after you enter your Douban username and passwd, it will 
create a file named "songlist.txt", where contains your favorite song list.
The code is a little ugly, for the html parse process,but it works however.

usage:
1 change fm_get_music.py, put your Douban username and passwd.
2 run fm_get_music.py : python fm_get_music.py , it will produce a file "songlist.txt", 
3 run the script : python getsong.py -x ,will download music from Baidu Music ,according to the song list file.

Notes:
1 just test on Linux, for Windows there maybe some new problems
2 if the song title contains language such as Franch, it may not be processed correctly.
3 getsong.py is written by Xupeng Yun <recordus@gmail.com>, and I added some modification.
